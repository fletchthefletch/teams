An idea-turned-program that's a basic script for assigning 5-aside football players into teams (based on predefined parameters)

### Features

 - I've added multiple team print options to the script

Execution
This script requires an excel datasheet with the following format to execute correctly:
 - single sheet document
 - rows and headers laid out in the pictured format:

Enjoy :-)
